**Minesweeper!**  

This is a CLI version of Minesweeper built using Ruby.  

My partner and I built it one afternoon as one of the exercices during [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/).  

**To play:**  
1. Download repository and bundle install (only one gem: Colorize).  
2. Run ``ruby mine.rb``.  
3. Enjoy!
