**Minesweeper!**

This is a CLI version of the classic [Minesweeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_%28video_game%29) built using Ruby.

My partner and I built it one afternoon as one of the exercices during [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/).

**To play:**
1. Download repository and bundle install (only one gem: Colorize).
2. Run ``ruby mine.rb``.
3. Enjoy!
